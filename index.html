            Welcome to the website of LIV Livres Solidaires!
          </h2>
          <p>
            LIV is a small non-profit organization based in Belgium. We collect and sort leisure reading books from Belgium and the North of France, then ship them to Haiti.
            There, we receive them and prepare small libraries for education projects, schools and libraries. Along the distribution of books, we train headmasters
            and librarians to ensure books are well maintained and can be read by as many people as possible.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our organization was created out of two main realizations. Firstly, there is an urgent need for reading materials in Haiti. While reading is universally recognized
            as a pillar of education, access to books is severely limited for the people of Haiti. Although elementary education is mandatory, many Haitian children
            have never read or held a book. Secondly, many people in Belgium struggle to find channels to donate their books. As a result, thousands upon thousands of books in good
            condition are recycled every year.
